Really I know it&#039;s\r\n\r\n00:08.820000,00:10.4690000\r\na bit different course from my usual\r\n\r\n00:10.4690000,00:13.20000\r\ntrivia videos but near the end of 2017,\r\n\r\n00:13.20000,00:15.90000\r\nI saw Vsauce host Michael Stevens and\r\n\r\n00:15.90000,00:18.3590000\r\nformer MythBuster Adam Savage in their\r\n\r\n00:18.3590000,00:20.970000\r\nlive science tour brain candy and it got\r\n\r\n00:20.970000,00:22.920000\r\nme inspired to try my hand at a science\r\n\r\n00:22.920000,00:24.930000\r\nvideo so I&#039;m going to show you some\r\n\r\n00:24.930000,00:27.240000\r\ntrivia about the sound of your household\r\n\r\n00:27.240000,00:29.670000\r\nmicrowave oven! As fascinating as they\r\n\r\n00:29.670000,00:31.80000\r\ncan be I do not encourage tampering with\r\n\r\n00:31.80000,00:33.390000\r\none yourself unless you&#039;re following\r\n\r\n00:33.390000,00:34.980000\r\nmaintenance instructions provided with\r\n\r\n00:34.980000,00:38.510000\r\nthe microwave. Now why do microwaves hum?\r\n\r\n00:38.510000,00:40.440000\r\nBecause they don&#039;t know the words, but\r\n\r\n00:40.440000,00:43.3790000\r\nwhat do microwaves hum. If you&#039;ve been\r\n\r\n00:43.3790000,00:45.210000\r\naround a microwave has it sounded\r\n\r\n00:45.210000,00:50.010000\r\n like this, if you live in the Americas or some\r\n\r\n00:50.010000,00:51.8990000\r\nparts of Asia your microwave will\r\n\r\n00:51.8990000,00:54.4490000\r\nresonate at this frequency around 120\r\n\r\n00:54.4490000,00:56.6990000\r\nHertz or about halfway between a sharp\r\n\r\n00:56.6990000,00:59.5790000\r\nand B and octave below middle C. In other\r\n\r\n00:59.5790000,01:01.71000000000000090000\r\nparts of the world you&#039;ll hear 100 Hertz\r\n\r\n01:01.71000000000000090000,01:04.2900000000000060000\r\nmicrowaves or between G and G sharp, an\r\n\r\n01:04.2900000000000060000,01:06.1800000000000070000\r\noctave below middle C. But these\r\n\r\n01:06.1800000000000070000,01:08.0400000000000060000\r\nfrequencies are consistent microwave to\r\n\r\n01:08.0400000000000060000,01:10.140000\r\nmicrowave and that&#039;s because microwaves\r\n\r\n01:10.140000,01:12.3299999999999980000\r\nare humming the tone of the electricity\r\n\r\n01:12.3299999999999980000,01:13.9500000000000030000\r\nbeing supplied to them from the main\r\n\r\n01:13.9500000000000030000,01:16.140000\r\npower line. The power lines around the\r\n\r\n01:16.140000,01:17.7000000000000030000\r\nworld supply electricity with a\r\n\r\n01:17.7000000000000030000,01:19.7990000000000070000\r\nfrequency of 50 Hertz or 60 Hertz\r\n\r\n01:19.7990000000000070000,01:22.3199999999999930000\r\ndepending on where you live. That means\r\n\r\n01:22.3199999999999930000,01:24.720000\r\n50 or 60 cycles of electricity get\r\n\r\n01:24.720000,01:26.7590000\r\npumped into the microwave per second.\r\n\r\n01:26.7590000,01:28.890000\r\nEven when the microwave isn&#039;t running\r\n\r\n01:28.890000,01:31.3799999999999950000\r\nthis creates a magnetic field around it.\r\n\r\n01:31.3799999999999950000,01:33.420000\r\nWhen voltage is applied while the\r\n\r\n01:33.420000,01:35.7290000\r\nmicrowave is running, a hum becomes\r\n\r\n01:35.7290000,01:37.9790000\r\naudible as the magnetic field starts to\r\n\r\n01:37.9790000,01:40.110000\r\ncause enclosed microwave parts to\r\n\r\n01:40.110000,01:42.5400000000000060000\r\nvibrate. The influence of the magnetic\r\n\r\n01:42.5400000000000060000,01:44.70000\r\nfield is strongest twice every cycle of\r\n\r\n01:44.70000,01:47.640000\r\nelectricity so since there are 50 or 60\r\n\r\n01:47.640000,01:49.530000\r\ncycles of electricity per second the\r\n\r\n01:49.530000,01:51.750000\r\nresulting hum has a frequency twice that\r\n\r\n01:51.750000,01:55.840000\r\nmuch. That&#039;s the lower note in this chord *humming that tone*\r\n\r\n01:55.840000,02:00.459999999999993750000\r\nthat note the upper note *hums* is the fan\r\n\r\n02:00.459999999999993750000,02:02.2289999999999990000\r\ninside the microwave keeping its\r\n\r\n02:02.2289999999999990000,02:04.32899999999999350000\r\ncomponents from overheating. The two\r\n\r\n02:04.32899999999999350000,02:06.1889999999999930000\r\ntones together produce this soothing\r\n\r\n02:06.1889999999999930000,02:09.3990000000000010000\r\nchord a satisfying drone with which you\r\n\r\n02:09.3990000000000010000,02:12.0689999999999880000\r\nmay find spiritual resonance safe with\r\n\r\n02:12.0689999999999880000,02:13.8700000000000050000\r\nthe knowledge, that your pizza is\r\n\r\n02:13.8700000000000050000,02:18.250000\r\nsteadily reheating. *clears throat* So that&#039;s what your\r\n\r\n02:18.250000,02:21.818999999999990000\r\nmicrowave hums while it&#039;s running, if you\r\n\r\n02:21.818999999999990000,02:23.7690000000000050000\r\nhear a hum while the microwave is not\r\n\r\n02:23.7690000000000050000,02:25.598999999999990000\r\nrunning that&#039;s a sign that a component\r\n\r\n02:25.598999999999990000,02:27.818999999999990000\r\nof the microwave is malfunctioning. But,\r\n\r\n02:27.818999999999990000,02:30.970000\r\nwhen it&#039;s just plugged in, inactive and\r\n\r\n02:30.970000,02:34.2690000000000050000\r\nquiet, you can generate a hum from its\r\n\r\n02:34.2690000000000050000,02:36.818999999999990000\r\nidle magnetic field simply by bringing a\r\n\r\n02:36.818999999999990000,02:38.979999999999990000\r\nmicrophone close to it. The magnetic\r\n\r\n02:38.979999999999990000,02:40.568999999999990000\r\nfield will influence the microphone\r\n\r\n02:40.568999999999990000,02:43.590000\r\ncreating a ghost hum, of 50 or 60 Hertz\r\n\r\n02:43.590000,02:46.509999999999990000\r\nstraight from the power line. This is\r\n\r\n02:46.509999999999990000,02:48.190000\r\nwhat you&#039;re hearing now. The magnetic\r\n\r\n02:48.190000,02:51.340000\r\nfield, of my microwave creates a 60 Hertz\r\n\r\n02:51.340000,02:54.128999999999990000\r\nhum as I move my hand into and out of it\r\n\r\n02:54.128999999999990000,02:56.949999999999990000\r\nwith this microphone. This phenomenon is\r\n\r\n02:56.949999999999990000,03:00.370000000000004550000\r\ncalled Mains Hum. Mains Hum occurs\r\n\r\n03:00.370000000000004550000,03:02.2899999999999920000\r\nwhenever magnetic fields from electrical\r\n\r\n03:02.2899999999999920000,03:04.7199999999999990000\r\nappliances or wiring are either audible\r\n\r\n03:04.7199999999999990000,03:06.9399999999999980000\r\nby themselves or picked up by audio\r\n\r\n03:06.9399999999999980000,03:08.6090000000000090000\r\nequipment like microphones and speakers,\r\n\r\n03:08.6090000000000090000,03:10.9300000000000070000\r\nproducing a hum of the frequency of the\r\n\r\n03:10.9300000000000070000,03:13.6899999999999980000\r\npower line. To hear the Mains Hum you\r\n\r\n03:13.6899999999999980000,03:15.5790000000000080000\r\nneed either an appliance that picks up\r\n\r\n03:15.5790000000000080000,03:18.009999999999990000\r\nenough electricity to vibrate idly, such\r\n\r\n03:18.009999999999990000,03:19.6599999999999970000\r\nas some transformer boxes or\r\n\r\n03:19.6599999999999970000,03:22.1200000000000050000\r\nrefrigerators or audio equipment that\r\n\r\n03:22.1200000000000050000,03:23.979999999999990000\r\ncan be affected by a nearby magnetic\r\n\r\n03:23.979999999999990000,03:27.4300000000000070000\r\nfield. This Mains Hum is the song every\r\n\r\n03:27.4300000000000070000,03:29.50000\r\nelectrical appliance knows.
