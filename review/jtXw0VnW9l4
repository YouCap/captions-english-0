Like, for whatever reason you just could not miss.\r\n\r\n00:09.400,00:10.600\r\nYeah me neither.\r\n\r\n00:00:10.600,00:00:14.900\r\nWell, today we're gonna try something that will actually make you not suck so much at Rocket League.\r\n\r\n00:00:14.900,00:00:18.000\r\nThat's right, we literally made the first Rocket League aimbot.\r\n\r\n00:00:18.100,00:00:21.900\r\nBasically, your opponent is playing the game like normal, just a regular game for them,\r\n\r\n00:00:22.000,00:00:28.700\r\nBut you with the aimbot at full intensity pretty much cannot miss with this thing, which is as funny as it sounds.\r\n\r\n00:00:31.300,00:00:34.900\r\nLethamyr: What is that?! W- Oh my god, it just flew right in!\r\n\r\n00:00:34.900,00:00:40.400\r\nSunless: Now I know what you're thinking. We don't want to get banned like Jarvis in Fortnite, but it's okay. This only works in local matches.\r\n\r\n00:00:40.400,00:00:44.400\r\nIt's completely impossible to use on Rocket League servers or online at all.\r\n\r\n00:00:44.400,00:00:48.500\r\nIn order to use it, you have to host a local game, which is exactly what I did for my victims.\r\n\r\n00:00:48.500,00:00:49.400\r\nI mean friends.\r\n\r\n00:00:49.400,00:00:55.300\r\nSo the aimbot was designed by the same genius who made the dogfighting mod and my FIFA camera mode: a dude named Cinderblock.\r\n\r\n00:00:55.300,00:00:58.900\r\nIn classic Cinderblock fashion, he made this in like half a day. It was ridiculous.\r\n\r\n00:00:58.900,00:01:03.600\r\nSo it's kind of like the game mode Heatseeker, but what makes this truly an aimbot and not Heatseeker,\r\n\r\n00:01:03.600,00:01:08.600\r\nIs that I can control who has it: The blue team, or the orange team, or both during the game\r\n\r\n00:01:08.600,00:01:12.800\r\nI can also control how powerful it is, and the biggest feature is unlike Heatseeker,\r\n\r\n00:01:12.800,00:01:16.600\r\nIt looks exactly like regular Rocket League. None of that bright ball trail action.\r\n\r\n00:01:16.600,00:01:21.500\r\nSo I challenged 5 players to a 1v1 and slowly turned up the intensity as we played\r\n\r\n00:01:21.500,00:01:25.500\r\nTo see when they would start to notice that I was draining every single shot perfectly.\r\n\r\n00:01:25.500,00:01:28.100\r\nThe most difficult opponent - at pro level - would be Lethamyr,\r\n\r\n00:01:28.100,00:01:34.000\r\nSo I wanted to see if I could actually beat a pro for the first time by using my secret weapon: The Rocket League aimbot.\r\n\r\n00:01:34.000,00:01:35.800\r\nMusty: I'm actually getting triggered.\r\n\r\n00:01:35.800,00:01:39.300\r\nSunless: Overall, the result was pretty hilarious, so let me show you how it all played out.\r\n\r\n00:01:42.300,00:01:46.500\r\nFluump: Let's go! Okay.\r\nSunless: So we just 1v1 first.\r\n\r\n00:01:47.000,01:51.300\r\nMusty: Normal 1v1?\r\nSunless: Yeah, just a 1v1. And you get points if you actually beat me.\r\n\r\n00:01:51.300,00:01:52.700\r\nMusty: Alright. Well, that'll be easy.\r\n\r\n00:01:54.200,00:01:55.300\r\nLethamyr: Hmmm...\r\n\r\n00:01:56.600,00:02:00.900\r\nSunless: No, my boost. No, you took it!\r\nLethamyr: Oh, I'll take that one as well.\r\n\r\n00:02:01.100,00:02:07.000\r\nVirge: You should be intimidated by my title.\r\nSunless: Well, you're just a coach so you didn't...\r\n\r\n00:02:07.100,00:02:08.900\r\nVirge: I get so many people telling me that I don't deserve it in ranked.\r\n\r\n00:02:09.000,00:02:14.600\r\nSunless: But I didn't mean it. I know you deserve it. It's people that don't like follow sports, I guarantee.\r\n\r\n00:02:14.600,00:02:17.100\r\n'Cause in sports, everybody in the franchise gets the ring.\r\n\r\n00:02:17.200,00:02:18.400\r\nSunless: Okay, ceiling shot Musty.\r\n\r\n00:02:20.900,00:02:22.200\r\nOh my god, I'm actually gonna do it.\r\n\r\n00:02:22.200,00:02:22.800\r\nOH!\r\n\r\n00:02:23.300,00:02:25.200\r\nNo...\r\n\r\n00:02:25.100,00:02:27.900\r\nMusty: That was a good shot, that was a good shot.\r\n\r\n02:27.900,02:31.900\r\nSunless: Dude I promise I do not have someone else playing for me. I actually just ceiling'd Musty.\r\n\r\n00:02:31.900,02:36.000\r\nMusty: It's cause you saw me do it yesterday.\r\nSunless: Now I'm more hyped about that then the game I'm playing.\r\n\r\n00:02:37.300,00:02:38.100\r\nSunless: Challenging.\r\n\r\n00:02:38.100,00:02:39.000\r\nNo!\r\n\r\n00:02:39.100,00:02:40.400\r\nMertzy: Good game.\r\n\r\n00:02:40.500,00:02:42.900\r\nSunless: It's okay, I- like, I know I can come back.\r\n\r\n00:02:44.200,00:02:45.600\r\nSunless: Come on, challenge.\r\n\r\n00:02:48.800,00:02:49.700\r\nFluump: Sure!\r\n\r\n00:02:50.900,00:02:51.700\r\nSunless: Oh...\r\n\r\n00:02:52.600,00:02:56.300\r\nFluump: Oh, I thought that wasn't going in.\r\nSunless: Scores on me.\r\n\r\n02:56.300,00:02:59.400\r\nFluump: I don't feel like anything is changing.\r\n\r\n00:03:01.500,00:03:07.000\r\nSunless: Ah, he hits those! It's okay, I'm feeling confident. I think I can get the comeback here.\r\n\r\n00:03:11.700,00:03:16.700\r\nSunless: Oh, man, the air dribble's nuts.\r\nLethamyr: I'm looking around...\r\n\r\n00:03:19.100,00:03:20.600\r\nSunless: Aw, shoot.\r\n\r\n00:03:20.600,03:23.500\r\nLethamyr: Cause I don't know if I'm missing anything? Let's see.\r\n\r\n00:03:27.600,00:03:29.500\r\nSunless: Is that in? Oh, good save.\r\n\r\n00:03:30.500,03:34.500\r\nFluump: Ha, you cannot demo me now.\r\n\r\n00:03:34.500,00:03:36.600\r\nSunless: I'll just blame everything on the update.\r\n\r\n00:03:37.100,00:03:39.600\r\nSunless: Oh... nice.\r\nFluump: 2 to 2.\r\n\r\n00:03:44.600,00:03:49.300\r\nMertzy: It's gonna happen isn't it I'm gonna get them like the entire time.\r\nSunless: Oh my god is that in?\r\n\r\n00:03:49.300,00:03:52.400\r\nMertzy: Yeah of course.\r\nSunless: It's actually in.\r\n\r\n03:54.000,03:55.500\r\nSunless: That's off...\r\n\r\n00:03:56.300,00:03:58.300\r\nSunless: Let's goooo\r\nMusty: Oh god\r\n\r\n00:04:01.100,00:04:03.300\r\nLethamyr: That was a little weird.\r\n\r\n04:03.300,04:08.300\r\nSunless: What?\r\nLethamyr: The ball acted a little bit strange I don't see anything so far\r\n\r\n04:08.500,00:04:12.100\r\nI'm the fifth person to do this?\r\nSunless: Yeah... dang it you're crushing me\r\n\r\n00:04:14.200,00:04:16.900\r\nThose demos feel kind of crisp it's not gonna lie\r\n\r\n00:04:17.600,00:04:20.800\r\nVirge: Oooo nice little flicker doodle.\r\nSunless: Thank you\r\n\r\n04:20.900,00:04:23.100\r\nVirge: I haven't- this is my first time playing today so I haven't had the chance to...\r\n\r\n00:04:23.100,04:29.000\r\nLethamyr: I know your ways Sunless; the content god of Rocket League can't can't be fooling me today\r\n\r\n00:04:30.200,00:04:32.200\r\nFluump: What was I doing there?\r\n\r\n00:04:34.000,00:04:38.300\r\nThat was really nice, nice placement. \r\nSunless: Thank you. Yeah pretty accurate with my shots.\r\n\r\n00:04:38.300,00:04:45.100\r\nLethamyr: No, just that, that you're uh, that you're sweating pretty hard.\r\nSunless: *laughs* Oh, yeah, always sweating.\r\n\r\n00:04:45.300,00:04:48.300\r\nLethamyr: Okay, okay...\r\nSunless: Do you think that I'm gonna come back?\r\n\r\n00:04:48.300,00:04:53.300\r\nMusty: Yeah for real though, they should add Musty and Sunless flags.\r\n\r\n00:04:53.300,04:57.000\r\nWait, wait! The ball is definitely curving.\r\n\r\n04:57.000,00:05:01.100\r\nSunless: You just hit it straight. \r\nMusty: Oh my god. What the heck Sunless.\r\nSunless: You literally just hit it straight.\r\n\r\n05:01.200,05:03.000\r\nThat's in.\r\nMusty: No way...\r\n\r\n05:03.000,05:07.000\r\nYou hit that to the left of the goal and it curled in a little bit maybe.\r\n\r\n00:05:10.800,00:05:14.300\r\nMertzy: What?!\r\nSunless: Let's gooo\r\n\r\n05:14.300,00:05:16.100\r\nMetzy: Wait a second.\r\n\r\n00:05:16.100,00:05:18.100\r\nLethamyr: Oh my goodness\r\n\r\n05:19.500,00:05:22.100\r\nSunless: Ooo I think that's in.\r\nLethamyr: It's weird.\r\n\r\n05:22.100,05:24.300\r\nI don't know man...\r\n\r\n00:05:24.300,00:05:27.600\r\nI'm being heavily trolled here and I don't like it\r\n\r\n00:05:27.600,00:05:32.100\r\nMusty: *laughs* I knew it.\r\nSunless: I don't know, you're up by five goals. I think the camera was just swiveling.\r\n\r\n00:05:32.100,05:36.500\r\nMusty: I don't maybe... Is it always curving towards your goal?\r\n\r\n05:36.500,00:05:38.100\r\nSunless: *laughs* It's not curving\r\nMusty: *laughs* It's not letting me score\r\n\r\n00:05:38.100,00:05:42.300\r\nSunless: What? No, I'm not- I'm not doing anything dude.\r\n\r\n05:42.300,00:05:43.800\r\nMusty: Oh my god Sunless\r\n\r\n00:05:44.300,05:47.500\r\nBro you are hacking, you have some hacks bro.\r\n\r\n05:47.500,00:05:50.300\r\nSunless: Nothing's different\r\nMusty: It's curving into your goal!\r\n\r\n00:05:50.300,00:05:53.100\r\nMertzy: The ball actually like moved in your favor\r\n\r\n00:05:53.300,00:05:56.100\r\nSunless: OK, wow\r\nMertzy: No joke, no joke.\r\n\r\n05:56.100,06:01.100\r\nThis doesn't make sense. What have you done? Why is the ball curving?\r\n\r\n06:06.000,00:06:10.800\r\nVerge: Oh did you double? okay. Oh wait a minute, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.\r\n\r\n00:06:11.500,00:06:13.500\r\nFluump: Oh nice... speed\r\n\r\n00:06:13.600,00:06:15.600\r\nSunless: Very speedy\r\n\r\n00:06:17.000,00:06:19.000\r\nFluump: Hmm well, uh\r\n\r\n00:06:19.800,06:24.500\r\nOkay, okay, I see this I see this whatever's happening right now.\r\n\r\n06:24.500,00:06:28.800\r\nSunless: What? I don't miss. I put that right on target.\r\n\r\n00:06:28.800,06:34.000\r\nFluump: Okay, this is uh... That was a nice shot honestly.\r\nSunless: Thanks\r\n\r\n00:06:40.000,00:06:41.300\r\nLethamyr: Okay\r\n\r\n00:06:41.300,00:06:43.300\r\nOh it's weird.\r\nSunless: Yeah\r\n\r\n00:06:43.600,00:06:46.100\r\nMusty: Okay, okay, I'm saving this replay.\r\n\r\n06:46.100,06:50.000\r\nSunless: Is this what happens when I'm leading by two goals?\r\nMusty: You mean by one goal you mean?\r\n\r\n06:50.000,00:06:53.600\r\nOkay, that was just too good of a shot. It didn't need like a curve.\r\n\r\n00:06:53.600,00:06:57.300\r\nSunless: It didn't... Wait so you're saying it only curves for bad shots?\r\nMusty: Yeah, I think so.\r\n\r\n00:06:57.300,07:00.500\r\nDid we auto team or did you pick like the blue team?\r\n\r\n00:07:01.100,00:07:06.300\r\nOkay, I could have saved that but I'm not gonna lose to you even with this placebo disadvantage.\r\n\r\n00:07:07.600,00:07:09.600\r\nThat's totally not curving.\r\n\r\n00:07:11.700,00:07:14.100\r\nYeah, whenever I hit it I swear it's not curving.\r\n\r\n00:07:14.800,07:21.000\r\nSo confused, I don't know how you pulled this off man. You know some... you know Bakkes? You like know him personally?\r\n\r\n07:21.000,00:07:23.300\r\nSunless: I have met Bakkes.\r\n\r\n00:07:23.300,00:07:26.600\r\nVerge: little suspicious on that accuracy right there.\r\nSunless: I don't know what you're talking about.\r\n\r\n07:26.600,00:07:28.800\r\nVirge: You just been practicing, huh?\r\nSunless: I hit my targets dude.\r\n\r\n00:07:28.800,00:07:31.300\r\nVirge: Yeah, I can... I can see that.\r\n\r\n07:31.300,07:33.300\r\nI got a feeling... \r\nSunless: Deadly accuracy\r\n\r\n00:07:33.300,07:35.500\r\nVirge: I got a feeling I gotta go to net here on this one.\r\n\r\n00:07:40.600,00:07:45.400\r\nIt takes a hundred percent. Yeah dude, it's basically Heatseeker at this point. What is this?\r\n\r\n00:07:48.500,00:07:53.600\r\nFluump: Nice save. Can I half flip? Hope I can- oh what the? Okay, okay.\r\n\r\n00:07:54.000,00:07:56.300\r\nSunless: We don't miss man. I don't miss\r\n\r\n07:56.500,00:08:00.600\r\nLethamyr: Whenever you shoot, whenever you hit the ball, it starts to aim towards my net.\r\n\r\n00:08:00.600,00:08:02.500\r\nSunless: Are you accusing me of aim botting?\r\n\r\n08:02.500,08:04.500\r\nLethamyr: Yes, actually I am.\r\n\r\n00:08:05.100,00:08:11.800\r\nSunless: I don't feel like I'm doing anything different... Better hold off my comeback 'cause I'm all of a sudden feeling really good\r\n\r\n00:08:12.400,00:08:14.400\r\nFluump: All you have to do is touch it.\r\n\r\n00:08:15.100,00:08:17.300\r\nI don't have enough boost.\r\n\r\n00:08:17.500,00:08:22.100\r\nMertzy: Yo, you know what screw you, I'm staying in goal.\r\n\r\n00:08:24.600,00:08:29.100\r\nDude it's not it's not Heatseeker. Is it?\r\nSunless: No\r\n\r\n00:08:29.100,00:08:33.700\r\nMertzy: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. That's how posts work.\r\n\r\n08:33.700,08:38.000\r\nMusty: What the heck bro?\r\n\r\n08:38.000,00:08:40.700\r\nI'm like actually getting triggered. Okay, there we go.\r\n\r\n08:40.800,08:45.800\r\n...or if like you're like making it weird or something\r\n\r\n00:08:46.700,00:08:48.700\r\nVirge: Apparently man. Apparently you're just...\r\n\r\n00:08:49.400,00:08:51.400\r\noutsmarting me at every turn.\r\n\r\n08:52.000,00:08:55.600\r\nSunless: That's just the way Rocket League is like, the better player...\r\n\r\n00:08:55.600,00:09:00.600\r\nVirge: I guess that's how it goes man. I guess that's how it... I guess that's how it goes.\r\n\r\n09:00.600,00:09:02.800\r\nSunless: The better player finds a way. Come back!\r\n\r\n00:09:02.800,00:09:09.100\r\nMusty: Okay, bro, I knew you were hitting some sort of button. Oh what?! Sunless!\r\n\r\n00:09:10.400,00:09:16.100\r\nI'll still save it bro.\r\nSunless: Yeah, my shot was just a little off. It's unfortunate. Oh, that's rough.\r\n\r\n00:09:16.800,00:09:22.100\r\nMusty: I'm winning even though you're clearly hacking the game right now. I will still beat you Sunless.\r\n\r\n00:09:22.100,00:09:25.800\r\nSunless: Look your shot's normal dude.\r\nMusty: Yeah, my shot looks normal.\r\n\r\n00:09:25.700,09:29.500\r\nYour shot you clicked the "put the ball super fast in the net" button.\r\n\r\n09:34.000,09:37.500\r\nMusty: Noooo, good shot, good shot. Good shot there Sunless.\r\n\r\n09:37.500,00:09:44.800\r\nLethamyr: Basically all I need to do is make sure that I hit the ball second and the ball will act normally for me.\r\n\r\n09:48.000,09:50.000\r\nLethamyr: Oh\r\n\r\n00:09:50.500,00:09:52.500\r\nThat's so cool thank you.\r\n\r\n00:09:53.500,00:09:56.500\r\nSunless: Man it's so weird how 50s just kind of bounce out sometimes.\r\n\r\n09:56.500,10:00.500\r\nVirge: Yeah, and just like yeah it is. There must be some like wind today or something.\r\n\r\n10:00.500,10:03.800\r\nSunless: Oh yeah, yep, that's Smashville.\r\n\r\n00:10:03.700,10:05.500\r\nMerzty: Stop\r\n\r\n10:05.500,00:10:09.600\r\nMertzy: Do it. Yeah, that's what I thought.\r\n\r\n00:10:10.100,00:10:13.800\r\nSo what I thought, that's what I thought. There we go!\r\n\r\n00:10:15.700,00:10:17.800\r\nThis is gonna get worse?\r\n\r\n10:17.900,10:22.500\r\nFluump: Can I even score is the question?\r\nSunless: I mean, try.\r\n\r\n00:10:22.800,00:10:24.800\r\nFluump: No, I... *laughs*\r\n\r\n00:10:25.200,00:10:27.800\r\nSunless: You're gonna need to hit it a little harder than that.\r\n\r\n10:27.900,00:10:30.200\r\nLethamyr: Has anybody beat you?\r\nSunless: Nope.\r\n\r\n00:10:31.800,10:34.500\r\nOh nice. That was important.\r\nLethamyr: I knew something was happening.\r\n\r\n00:10:35.200,00:10:37.600\r\nI'm gonna try and win this see if I can hold the off here.\r\n\r\n00:10:38.700,00:10:41.200\r\nYour mistake was letting it so that if I touch the ball\r\n\r\n00:10:41.200,10:43.500\r\nIt doesn't actually move so I can keep it away from you this whole time\r\n\r\n00:10:44.700,10:48.500\r\nLethamyr: Noooo, dude it's so fast.\r\n\r\n10:48.500,10:52.800\r\nSunless: Oh no, no no no. I'm back, I'm back, don't worry about it.\r\n\r\n00:10:52.800,00:10:55.300\r\nMertzy: Oh what a great touch Sunless.\r\nSunless: Thank you.\r\n\r\n00:10:55.300,00:10:59.300\r\nMertzy: Yeah, I think it was a ground pinch. Yeah, it got a little bit of a curve as well.\r\n\r\n00:11:02.600,00:11:05.100\r\nMusty: Come on bro.\r\n\r\n11:05.100,11:10.000\r\nIt's not just at the net, it's like at the net where I can't even get it at all.\r\n\r\n00:11:11.200,00:11:15.200\r\nLethamyr: So as the time goes down is that what it is as the time goes that it gets stronger for you? That's pretty cool.\r\n\r\n00:11:15.200,00:11:17.500\r\nSunless: No I'm controlling it.\r\nLethamyr: Oh, you are controlling it? Okay\r\n\r\n00:11:18.700,00:11:23.700\r\nSunless: Ah, wow, the come back. All my shots are just finding their mark.\r\n\r\n11:23.700,11:27.500\r\nLethamyr: Yeah, so, so strange Sunless.\r\n\r\n11:27.500,11:29.500\r\nSunless: Nice save!\r\nLethamyr: Thank you.\r\n\r\n00:11:30.800,00:11:32.800\r\nSunless: Oh, good second touch.\r\n\r\n00:11:33.100,00:11:37.300\r\nIf I just touch it...\r\nLethamyr: All you have to do is touch it and it goes towards the net. That's crazy.\r\n\r\n00:11:40.200,00:11:41.700\r\nSunless: Good save...\r\n\r\n00:11:43.100,00:11:44.200\r\nSunless: Oh no...\r\n\r\n00:11:44.200,00:11:49.200\r\nSunless: I mean that was probably the ping.\r\nMertzy: Yeah\r\n\r\n00:11:50.800,00:11:55.800\r\nYou don't, you don't, you don't stop.\r\nSunless: You'll get it next time maybe.\r\n\r\n00:11:57.700,00:12:01.100\r\nThat's unfortunate. Twenty-five seconds, I tied up.\r\n\r\n00:12:01.100,00:12:04.600\r\nMertzy: Oh my god, Sunless what are you doing?\r\nSunless: That's tough...\r\n\r\n00:12:12.200,12:17.000\r\nFluump: That was actually really funny, you were definitely gonna own-goal that.\r\n\r\n00:12:18.700,12:21.000\r\nLethamyr: Oh I got through! Let's go!\r\n\r\n12:21.000,12:26.000\r\nAnd now that I know the game, I'm playing it, I'm feeling it. I have to keep away from your touches.\r\n\r\n00:12:26.800,00:12:31.200\r\nWhat are you gonna do here it's gonna come to me no matter what you do. What's he gonna do?\r\n\r\n00:12:33.600,00:12:38.300\r\nSunless: Oh, good touch.\r\nLethamyr: You're playing smart here. All I have to do is touch it!\r\n\r\n12:39.000,12:41.300\r\nLanded!\r\nSunless: Oh it landed!\r\n\r\n00:12:41.600,00:12:43.200\r\nLethamyr: Don't take my boost.\r\n\r\n00:12:46.800,00:12:48.800\r\nIt's like playing Heatseeker again.\r\n\r\n00:12:53.100,12:55.000\r\nLethamyr: What is that?!\r\n\r\n12:55.000,13:00.500\r\nOh my god, it just flew right in. Oh my gosh. I wanted to win that so bad.\r\n\r\n13:00.500,13:05.800\r\nI felt like I could've, I should've saved it. Nice play. I like this- *laughs*\r\n\r\n00:13:05.800,00:13:10.600\r\nSunless: So this is- you've been the test subject of the first Rocket League aimbot.\r\n\r\n00:13:10.600,13:11.800\r\nLethamyr: Wow\r\nMertzy: GG\r\n\r\n00:13:11.700,00:13:15.800\r\nSunless: Damn, I'm 9 for 9, I literally did not miss.\r\nMertzy: Yeah true, that's actually really good.\r\n\r\n13:15.900,00:13:22.300\r\nVirge: GG man, good game! You know what? You've got some tricks up your sleeve that I didn't even teach you\r\n\r\n13:22.500,13:25.000\r\nThis is Rocket League aimbot.\r\n\r\n13:25.000,13:29.200\r\nMusty: Really. Is the Musty Flick like real though? Like you actually did that, no hacks? \r\nSunless: Yes. Yeah.\r\n\r\n00:13:29.200,00:13:31.200\r\nNo hacks around that one.\r\n\r\n00:13:31.600,13:37.000\r\nVirge: I noticed it when you made a backboard save and it slowly curled all the way into my net.\r\n\r\n00:13:37.300,00:13:39.200\r\nSunless: Alright. Alright, I'll give you a shot now.\r\n\r\n13:39.200,00:13:42.800\r\nFluump: So do I have the setting now?\r\nSunless: Now you have the aimbot.\r\n\r\n00:13:45.600,13:47.000\r\nFluump: Dang\r\n\r\n00:13:47.000,00:13:51.600\r\nSunless: Nice shot dude.\r\nFluump: You found a way to beat me Sunless you found a way to beat me.\r\n\r\n00:13:52.100,00:13:57.100\r\nSunless: Oh my god.\r\nMertzy: I mean I watched like Scrub's kickoff tutorial. So I think that helped.\r\n\r\n00:13:57.100,00:14:00.000\r\nMusty: Dang it, I thought I could still beat you too with it.\r\n\r\n00:14:00.000,00:14:06.800\r\nBut like once you've cranked it up to like a hundred percent or whatever like there's no way I can save it. It's crazy dude.\r\n\r\n00:14:07.800,00:14:09.800\r\nLethamyr: Oh my god *laughs*\r\n\r\n00:14:11.300,00:14:12.900\r\nSunless: What a shot\r\n\r\n00:14:12.800,00:14:15.800\r\nLethamyr: Thank you. That was perfect placement by me.\r\n\r\n14:15.900,14:18.200\r\nThat was fun though. Thanks. Thanks for the invite.\r\nSunless: Yeah. You're welcome\r\n\r\n00:14:18.200,00:14:21.100\r\nI can beat a pro, if I have aimbot.\r\n\r\n14:21.100,00:14:37.300\r\n[Music]","nsfw":"false"}
